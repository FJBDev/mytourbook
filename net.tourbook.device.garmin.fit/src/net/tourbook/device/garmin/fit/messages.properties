                                               This feature can be used to rectify device temperature values which are \
                                               wrong. It's absolutely no fun to adjust wrong device values this way \
                                               but it is the only way when the manufacturer will not improve the \
                                               hardware.

                                               with a 1 second time slice. This will automatically also adjust the \
                                               tour recording time.\n\

                                               This feature is mainly used to fix device recording bugs, e.g. the \
                                               authors device created a time slice with a duration of more than 17 \
                                               years.
