                                                 are wrong. It's absolutely no fun to adjust wrong device values this \
                                                 way but it is the only way when the manufacturer will not improve the \

                                                 This feature is mainly used to fix device recording bugs, e.g. the \
                                                 authors device created a time slice with a duration of more than 17 \
                                                 years.
