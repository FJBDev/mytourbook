# Such messages are a symptom of the org.eclipse.update.configurator being installed. 
# The org.eclipse.update.configurator causes all bundles in plugins to be installed into the runtime. 
# To prevent this behaviour, set the org.eclipse.update.reconcile property to false for your product.
#
# org.eclipse.update.configurator is included as part of the org.eclipse.rcp feature and cannot be removed for historical reasons.
