* Tour blog

  - This view shows all texts which are entered for a tour (tour 
    description, weather and tour markers).

  - A Tour marker can be selected to navigate in other views, e.g. Tour 
    Chart, 2D/3D map.

  - Tour and tour markers can be edited.
 

	Linux Info
	----------

	It is very likely that the Tour Blog is not working with Linux, this
	error can occure: No more handles [Unknown Mozilla path 
	(MOZILLA_FIVE_HOME not set)]

	This feature is based on the browser widget, there are some hints 
	http://www.eclipse.org/swt/faq.php#browserlinux which may help you 
	to get it to work (MyTourbook 14.7 is based on Eclipse 3.8).
