Version 18.9.0                                             ?. September 2018

The target for this new version was to use Eclipse 4 as backend, there are no other new features, except a few bugfixes.

Eclipse 3 -> Eclipse 4
======================

These are the issues which are already found

* Product size

  The size of the product is now 12 MByte larger than before because the old Eclipse 3 code is still used in the compatibility layer. The Eclipse IDE (which is the main Eclipse product) is also using the same compatibility layer as MyTourbook. 

* Search Tours View

  - A tour cannot be selected with the mouse in the embedded browser (this still works with an external browser), however navigating with the keyboard works in the embedded browser.
    Workaround: Select next/previous tour with mouse (selection marker is not visible) and navigate with the keyboard up/down

* Software Update

  - The features "Check for Updates" and "Install New Software..." are not working, they are already rarely used   


Bugfix
