Version 18.9.0                                                   31. August 2018


New
===	

* Java 9 / 10 Support

* Eclipse 4

  There are some minimal UI adjustments, e.g. toolbar has a few less pixels for 
  the spacing


Common Issues
==============	

* First App Start / Switch Perspective

  There was an issue logged when another perspective was selected but this could
  also occure in other cases, e.g. first app start, and the UI was partly 
  corrupted.

  org.eclipse.core.runtime.AssertionFailedException: null argument:Placeholder 
  net.tourbook.views.TourMarkerView does not point to a valid reference

  Workaround: After a restart, the app was working normally, in this case the 
  TourMarkerView was displayed correctly


* Search Tours View

  A tour cannot be selected with the mouse in the embedded browser (this still 
  works with an external browser), however navigating with the keyboard works 
  in the embedded browser.

  Workaround: Select a tour with the mouse, the selection marker is not visible 
  and navigate with the keyboard up/down

 
* Software Update

  The features Check for Updates and Install New Software... are not working, 
  they are already rarely used

 
Windows Issues 	
==============

* 2.5D Map

  This map is not displayed, it is tracked by this issue

 
Linux Issues 	
============

* 3D Map with Ubuntu 18.04

  This map is not displayed with the exception

  Exception in thread "AWT-EventQueue-0" javax.media.opengl.GLException:
  
  AWT-EventQueue-0: X11GLXContext.createContextImpl ctx !ARB, profile > GL2 
  requested (OpenGL >= 3.0.1).
  
  Requested: GLProfile[GL3bc/GL3bc.hw], current: 3.0 (Compat profile, 
  ES2 compat, FBO, hardware) - 3.0 Mesa 18.0.5

 
* Gtk

  The console shows some/many Gtk issues

  - GLib-CRITICAL **: g_base64_encode_step: assertion 'in != NULL' failed
  - Gtk-WARNING **: Negative content width -2 (allocation 0, extents 1x1) while 
    allocating gadget (node trough, owner GtkProgressBar)

    width 12 and height -14
  - Gtk-CRITICAL **: gtk_box_gadget_distribute: assertion 'size >= 0' failed in 
    GtkScrollbar
    *** BUG ***
    In pixman_region32_init_rect: Invalid rectangle passed
    Set a breakpoint on '_pixman_log_error' to debug

 
macOS Issues 	
============

* MyTourbook can crash suddenly when moving the mouse or doing other actions
* 2.5D map is not displayed correctly and can freeze the app

 
Bugfix 	
======

* Statistics View

  When tour types are not defined, the month/year statistics was empty
 

* Search POI

  Using https://... instead of http://..., http do not work anymore 

 
System 	
======

* Eclipse 4

  Eclipse 4 is the new framework which MyTourbook is using. The compatibility 
  layer is currently used with almost no E4 specific code, e.g. dependency 
  injection...


* Product Size

  The size of the product is now 12 MByte larger than before because the old 
  Eclipse 3 code is still used in the compatibility layer. The Eclipse IDE 
  (which is the main Eclipse product) is also using the same compatibility layer
  as MyTourbook
