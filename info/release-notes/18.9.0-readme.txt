Version 18.9.0                                             ?. September 2018

This version is VERY experimental.

The app is working and tour data should not be lost but there is currently not much experience if all features are working as expected.

The target for this new version was to use Eclipse 4 as backend. There are no other new features, except a few bugfixes. Some adjustments had to be made that the app is running again with Eclipse 4.


Eclipse 3 -> Eclipse 4 Issues
=============================

These are the issues which are already found

* First App Start / Switch Perspective

  There has been an issue logged when another perspective was selected but this could also occure in other case, e.g. first app start 
  
  "org.eclipse.core.runtime.AssertionFailedException: null argument:Placeholder net.tourbook.views.TourMarkerView does not point to a valid reference" 
  
  and the UI was partly corrupted. After an app restart, the app was working normally and in my case the TourMarkerView was displayed correctly.


* Search Tours View

  - A tour cannot be selected with the mouse in the embedded browser (this still works with an external browser), however navigating with the keyboard works in the embedded browser.
    Workaround: Select next/previous tour with mouse (selection marker is not visible) and navigate with the keyboard up/down


* Software Update

  - The features "Check for Updates" and "Install New Software..." are not working, they are already rarely used   


* Product Size

  The size of the product is now 12 MByte larger than before because the old Eclipse 3 code is still used in the compatibility layer. The Eclipse IDE (which is the main Eclipse product) is also using the same compatibility layer as MyTourbook. 


Bugfix
======

* Statistics View

  When tour types are not defined, the month/year statistics are empty
  

* Search POI

  Using https://... instead of http://..., http do not work anymore
