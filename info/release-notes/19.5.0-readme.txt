Bugfix

* Fixed IllegalArgumentException: Widget has the wrong parent
  This occured when app is started and a view is minimized, then the context menu is already created but has the wrong parent when the view is displayed later on.
  It took several iteration until the cause of this issue was discovered. This has propably occured after switching to Eclipse 4.
  Nobody compained until now maybe it was not used to minimize a view.
