Bugfix   
======

* .fitlog File 

  - Fixed avg power issue when value was a floating point


* Fixed IllegalArgumentException: Widget has the wrong parent
  This occured when app is started and a view is minimized, then the context menu is already created but has the wrong parent when the view is displayed later on.
  It needed a while until the cause of this issue was discovered. This has propably occured after switching to Eclipse 4.
  Nobody compained until now maybe it was not used to minimize a view.

* File Re-Import (Frederic)
  - Fixed a bug (when using Linux) where the reimport filedialog doesn't show
  

System
======

* FITSDK 20.90


Languages (Frederic)
========
* Completed, improved and fixed french translation
