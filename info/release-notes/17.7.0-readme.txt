* 2.5 D Tour Map

1st Time Start
--------------
When opening this map the 1st time, it may show no map, the map view is 
white. Press key <G> then it shows the tile grid and you know the map 
works. Because the default map provider can be very slow, therefore it 
also takes some seconds or more until the map tiles are being loaded.


These features are currently available in the 2.5D map
------------------------------------------------------
- Navigate map

- Show multiple tours

- Show/hide map layers

- Select map provider

- Keep these settings when the map is reopened
  - Map position, tilt and rotation
  - Map provider
 

This map is still VERY experimental !
=====================================

It is far from feature complete and there are still some raw edges.

- When map is resized, it can be displayed just black, moving it 
  slightly will show it again

- Sometimes it needs the workaround by moving the map slightly that a 
  tour or a newly selected tour is displayed in the map

- When multiple tours are selected then it can take some seconds until 
  the tours are rendered. This is done in the background and is not 
  visible, the map can still be navigated and sometimes the selected 
  tours appear.

- To log the map http requests, add this to the command line
  -debug -consolelog 
  -vmargs -Dorg.slf4j.simpleLogger.defaultLogLevel=DEBUG
