* Fulltext Search 

The search feature has been implemented in version 14.14 Alpha but was published
as experimental because of a major database update.

Since it was published, there has been no problems, therefore the search feature
is now in the normal release. In version 15.3 there are no changes in the 
database.

Compared with version 14.14 Alpha there are not many functional changes but the
UI has been replaced completly with the Dojo toolkit which is the reason why it
took so long.


Why Dojo and not SWT?

* The author was not happy with the typeahead of the search text field.
* Other reasons.


Improvements compared with 14.14 Alpha

* Paging of the search results has been replaced with a long list which is 
  loaded on demand (when the list is scrolled).
* Better typeahead when the search text is entered.
* Search result can be filtered by Tour/Marker/Waypoint.


Known Problems

* Some search options (checkboxes) cannot be changed with the keyboard, it works
  with the mouse or when the UI is running in an external web browser.
* Tooltips do not hide always when mouse is not hovering it, this is a bit 
  tricky depending where the mouse is moved.
* When the value point tooltip is displayed, the actions to edit a tour/marker 
  can fail, the dialog boxes getting closed immediately.
  Workaround: hide value point tooltip.
 

What's next?

There are many ideas how the search feature can be improved.
