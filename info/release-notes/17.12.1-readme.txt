  Because of substancial changes in the calendar profile management, new 
  default profiles are created.

  The old profiles are still available with all it's customized 
  properties. They can be used or deleted and appear in the profile list
  with an empty name and a DEFAULT config.


Improvements
============	

* FIT Import

  - Saving speed data has changed:

  - By default, speed values will not be saved anymore (when availabel),
    this can be configured in the preferences

  - Reorganized fit import preferences
 

Bugfix
======
	
* FIT Calorie Values

  Until now, ALL calorie values from the FIT import, are saved in kcal 
  and not in calories, so they are too small by the factor 1000. 
  With the FIT SDK, the calorie values can only be read in kcal.

  This version contains the new tool...
  Multiply calories value by 1000...
  ...in the tour book view to fix the wrong saved values.

  Additional UI updates for the calories values

  - Calories column in the tour book view show now kcal 
    instead of calories
    
  - The calendar view can show kcal/MJ  values

  - Edit kcal  values instead of cal values in the Tour Editor and 
    Quick Tour Editor


System
======	

* Debug Data

  - Documented debug commandline arguments
