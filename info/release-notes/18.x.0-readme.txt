Version 18.?.0                                        ?. January 2018


Improvements
============	

* Map 2.5D

  - Navigation with the keyboard
  

* Calendar

  - Set color for todays date
  
  - Changed week/tour layout:
  
    When year columns are displayed and the column start is not 
    continuously, the last and first week in adjacent columns contained
    a tour two times. 
    Now a tour is displayed only once in the correct column, this solved
    some existing navigation/positioning bugs


* Tour Book View

  - Link a tour in the tour book view when a tour is selected in another 
    directory view



System
======

* 2.5D Map

  - Separated platform files into plugin fragments
