Version 16.8                                              2. August 2016


New 	
===

* Statistics

  - Select chart grid options in the options slideout and set the 
    options for each chart (statistic) individually
  - Day summary statistics
    - New graphs for average speed/pace (the values are stacked for the
      same day, this can maybe improved)
    - Select visible graphs in the options slideout

  - Select tour frequency options in the options slideout
    (these options are removed now from the preference dialog)

  - Order bar sequence for month/year statistics
    Sort statistics sequence by data/time (in the preference dialog)

  Info
  ----

  When MyTourbook is opened with version 16.8 then the "old" statistic 
  view is not displayed any more, this is because of some internal 
  changes but all features are still available + new features.

  To open the "new" statistic view, select Directory / Statistics in 
  the app menu.

 
* Heart Rate Variability

  This is a new view, it requires heart rate time data (R-R time in ms)

 

Improvements 	
============

* Tour Chart

  - Easier acces to existing tools
    - Chart slideout for the chart smoothing tool
    - Chart slideout for the graph min/max values, this is a replacement
      for the preference page


* Map

  - Keep map position when a tour is saved, e.g. setting the tour marker
    position in the tour chart (which also saves the tour)


* Icons

  - A few icons changed slightly

 
Bugfix 	
======

These problems are fixed

* All Views
  All views are not updated when a tour is deleted,
  this was introduced when the tour log view is logging tour deletions
 
   
* Statistics
  Tour frequency statistic is wrong when stacked bars are displayed
