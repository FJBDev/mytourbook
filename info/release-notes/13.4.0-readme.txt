Experimental Feature: 3D Map 

This map is currently just a "simple" map with a few features: 
* Show/hide map layer 
* Terrain profile graph tool 

It is planned that tours and photos are also displayed. 

This map is displayed with the NASA World Wind SDK (why the application 
is now 10 MByte larger than before). 


3D Map Demos 

There are many demos which shows features which can be implemented in 
this map. 


Why is World Wind used instead of Google maps ? 

* Pro Google 
- There are many areas where Google map is better than 
World Wind. 

* Pro World Wind 
- No Ads. 
- No Google dependency. 
- No Google internet connection. 
- No over-engineered map navigation. 
- Anything can be customized. 


Map navigation 

Map navigation can be done with the buttons in the View Controls layer 
or with the Default Controls (mouse + keyboard) which are described here 
(in the lower part of the page). 


One Click Area 

The 3D Properties view contains an area where layers can be 
activated/deactivated very easily with the mouse. 

This area is on the right site of the view and it's width is one third 
of the whole view width. The mouse cursor will change when this area is 
hovered. 

Clicking inside this area is doing these actions: 
* Show/hide map layer. 
* Collapse/expand layer category. 


Terrain profile graph 

The Terrain profile graph tool can not be dragged to another location 
(like in the screenshot) because it's not working correctly with Linux. 



Linux: Crash out of the box :-( 

When running this 3D map in a Linux environment within VMWare it caused 
a lot of problems, native Linux is not yet tested. 

This map is running smoothly with Win 7 and OSX 10.6 (when you have a 
good graphic card :-) 


Linux problems 

* MyTourbook can crash when showing "Open Street Map" layer. It can 
display a few tiles but then it crashes.
* A lot of exception's can occure (see console) when showing layers 
which draw map tiles. 


Used Linux test environment 

* VMWare 8.0.5 
* Ubuntu 12.04 
* JRE version: 7.0_13-b20 
* Java VM: Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM (23.7-b01 mixed mode linux-x86 ) 


These layers can be displayed in Linux without problems 

* Stars 
* Atmosphere 
* Place Names 
* Scale bar 
* Terrain profile graph 
* View Controls 
* Status Layer
