* Running Dynamics
    
   What is Running Dynamics ? 2 months ago, I didn't know about it, 
   this feature was requested 
   https://sourceforge.net/p/mytourbook/discussion/622811/thread/762cef2c/
   
   Some links where you can find more info
   
   - http://fellrnr.com/wiki/Running_Dynamics
   - https://www8.garmin.com/...
   - https://www.dcrainmaker.com/...
   
   
   If you are a runner then you may be interested in these new features but 
   there are also some other improvements / changes in this version.
   
    
   These features are implemented for running dynamics:
   
   Tour Import
   -----------
    - Import running dynamics data from .fit files
    
   Tour Book view
   --------------
    - 15 new columns, min/max/average for
      - Stance time
      - Stance time balance
      - Step length
      - Vertical oscillation
      - Vertical ratio
   
    - Reimport Only Running Dynamics Values...
      to import running dynamics values for already saved tours
   
   Tour Chart
   ----------
    - 5 new graphs
    - Set graph min/max values
    - Set as default graph
    - Show in value point tooltip
   
   Tour Analyzer
   -------------
    - Show data for all 5 graphs
   
   2D Map
   ------
    - Show tour with Step Length colors
   
   All
   ---
    - Support metric/imperial measurement

 
Improvements
============	

* Tour Book
  - Summary (totals) row, in combination with the tour app filters it is now 
    easy to get the desired totals.
 

Tour Analyzer
=============

* Optimized performance by reducing paint events -> Moving the chart slider is 
  now more smoothly

 

Changes
=======	

* Tour Chart

  - The graph title is now displayed above the graph and not vertically at the 
    y-axis, this is better readable and the title will not disappear when there 
    is no space.
    This was necessary to display the longer titles for running dynamics.

* Tour Analyzer

  - The altitude average value will show now these values:
    Summarized altitude up values, when it is 0, then the summarized down values
    are displayed

 
Bugfix 	
======

* Map 2D

  - Map was not centered with the tour the first time, only the second time

* Statistics

  - Cleanup + disable tour type combo box when there are no tours

 
* Translation 	

  - Italian (Doriano Cometto)
    German

    
System 	
======

This release will be the last which is using the Eclipse 3 platform. The next 
version is based on Eclipse 4.

The first tries when using E4 looked very promising, after fixing 10 internal 
methods, it was mostly running.

After digging deeper the more problems occured, so it will be not be ready in 
the next few days.
