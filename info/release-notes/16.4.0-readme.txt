Version 16.4                                               4. April 2016

Last Minute Feature
===================

*Tour Segmenter

  - New segmenter: By Altitude (with DP) and Marker
  - Last row contains the total values for all segments
  - Segmenter colors can now be set in the segmenter slideout, this has 
    been moved from the preferences dialog to this location for easier 
    access
  - Fixed m/h values, in any previous versions these values were wrong 
    for smaller segments, larger segments were almost correct


New
===	

* Table/Tree Columns

  - Manage columns with profiles
  - Columns are categorized (when a view has ~ > 10 columns)
  - PREVIOUS COLUM ORDER HAS BEEN RESET - this was necessary to have 
    internally consistent data


* Power

  - Show power/powertrain/training values in the tourbook view, imported
    from .fit files
  - Show power value in tooltips
  - Reimport power values


* Tour/Quick Editor

  - Edit body weight, FTP


* Import

  - .fit import is much faster (with FIT SDK 16.60)



Cleanup Internal Data
=====================

The internal Eclipse data are located now (since this version) in the 
app installation folder, the old data are not used any more at the old 
location. They are not removed automatically, this has to be done 
manually.

In this location
Linux 	<User>/.mytourbook
Windows 	<User>\mytourbook

delete the folders org.eclipse.* but DO NOT DELETE OTHER FOLDERS, 
they contain the tour data.



System
======

* P2

P2 is used as the new software update tool



* Tycho

This is a maven driven tool to build the application

It took me some weeks to use/implement Tycho and P2 so that the app was
running and installed as before. I fixed many problems and hope that all
is fixed, after some weeks of testing and using, it looks very good.

The benefit is now, that the creation of the app is faster/easier and 
the app is prepared for E4, but moving to E4 is (sometime) another big
task.

These are the new tycho files to build the product
