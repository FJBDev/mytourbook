--------------------------------------------------------------------------
TEST

* !!! select body weight spinner with UBUNTU, temperature has a special UBUNTU flag !!!

* Win/UBUNTU: Remove obsolete folders from .mytourbook
  These folders are now in the install location, otherwise it did not work with P2 :-(


--------------------------------------------------------------------------
IDEAS

* bug with body weight in reimport
* smooth power data

--------------------------------------------------------------------------


Cleanup
=======

Since this version, some internal data (configuration) has been moved to the folder where the app is installed.
The old data are not removed automatically, it has to be done manually this way:
Delete in your user directory the folders org.eclipse.* within the folder mytourbook in Windows or .mytourbook in Linux, 
DO NOT DELETE OTHER FOLDERS because they contain your tours !!! 


New
===	

* Table/Tree Columns
  - Manage columns with profiles
  - Columns are categorized (when a view has ~ > 10 columns)
    !!! PREVIOUS COLUM ORDER HAS BEEN RESET !!! - this was necessary to have internally consistent data

* Power
  - Show power/powertrain/training values in the tourbook view (imported from .fit files)
  - Show power value in tooltips
  - Reimport power values
  
* Tour/Quick Editor
  - Edit body weight, FTP

* Import
  - .fit import is now much faster
    FIT SDK 16.60: "Changed Java File Encoder to use Checked Output Stream for added performance."


System
======

* P2
  This is the new software update tool

* Tycho
  This is a maven driven tool to build the application
 
* Eclipse internal data  
  These data are now written in the app folder, in the previous versions these data were saved in the user folder.
  The folders ... in the user folder can now be removed because they are not needed any more, there is no automatic cleanup.
  

Bugfix
======

* Ongoing
