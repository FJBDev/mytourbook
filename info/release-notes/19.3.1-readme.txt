Version 19.3.1                                             3. March 2019


Bugfix   
======

* Fixed ClassCastException in

  - Photo View
  - Tour Photos View
  - Training View
  
  - This exception occured in views which where not modified for months or years. 
  - The problem was, that invalid data were set in the parent UI control of the view and it seems, that Eclipse 4.9/10 have changed their code which revealed it.
  - Found the same problem in 17 other views but there was no error because a custom toolbar is not displayed which caused the exception
