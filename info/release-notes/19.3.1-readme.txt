Bugfix   
======

* Fixed ClassCastException in the Views 

  - Photos
  - Tour Photos
  - Training

 
  - This exception occured in views which where not modified for months 
    or years
    
  - The problem was, that invalid data were set in the parent UI control
    of the view and it seems, that Eclipse 4.9 or 4.10 have changed 
    their code which revealed it
    
  - The same problematic code was found in 17 other views but there was 
    no error because a custom toolbar is not yet displayed, this caused 
    the exception
