!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 

IMPORTANT INFO

Major structural changes for the tour database has been carried out in 
this version. It is STRONGLY recommended to do a BACKUP of the data 
because when the update fails, your saved tours will be lost forever. 

The database update is performing about 10 tours per second, my test 
values: 1727 tours / 149 seconds = 11.6 tours/second 

When the database update is performed and the splash screen has been 
covered with another window or the focus is set with the mouse, it can 
happen (on Win7) that the splash screen is not updated until the 
database update has finished which is showing an info box.

Klocke

* autocomplete tour title + start/end location in the tour editor with
existing values from all tours, provided by Stefan Fussenegger 

* new application icon and web site refreshed, the new icon reflects, 
that MyTourbook can be used for any kind of tours. The old icon seems to

reflects a bicycle helmet which was very important for me, I had very 
likely my cycling accident not survived without it.
