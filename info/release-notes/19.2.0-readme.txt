* Search Tour by Location

  Find all tours in the map where you drove through, this is some kind 
  of a heat map

  Examples

  1. The selected area contains tours
  2. Tours are excluded from the selected area

  EXPERIMENTAL

  This feature is in a very early stage and has some issues, but in some 
  parts it is already working

 
Improvements   
============

* Splash screen

  - Show better loading state
  - Removed progress bar

 
Bugfix   
======

* All Maps

  - Fixed reselecting multiple tours, e.g. in Tour Book view, from only 
    one selected tour, it did not redisplay multiple tours again. 
    This bug is available since the beginning of selecting multiple 
    tours
  - Sometimes selected tour(s) are not displayed because the internal 
    visible state was not correctly set


* Tour Editor

  - Fixed Linux async problem: modify flag is set when opening a 
    tour/event


Tour Import
===========

* .fit File

  - Fixed NPE when a lap has not an absolute time, this occured with 
    files from Sigma-ROX 12.0

* .gpx File

  - "Convert waypoints into tour markers" did not work
  - Set correct marker position when waypoint is converted into tour 
    marker

* Set speed from device by discovering any time slices and not only the 
  first


Join Tours
==========

* Set speed from device according to the joined tours
