Version 19.2.0                                         23. February 2019


New   
===

* Search Tour by Location

  It finds all tours in the map within a geo rectangle of 0.01°
  (~ 1.5 km / 1 mi).

  Examples
 
  1. All displayed tours have passed through the selected area (yellow 
     rectangle), e.g. this can find tours which are started from home.

  2. It can also find tours which did not drive through the selected 
     area, e.g. this can find tour which are not started from home.


  EXPERIMENTAL

  This feature is in a very early stage and has some issues, but in some 
  parts it is already working

 
Improvements   
============

* Splash screen

  - Show better loading state
  - Removed progress bar

 
Bugfix   
======

* All Maps

  - Fixed reselecting multiple tours, e.g. in Tour Book view, from only 
    one selected tour, it did not redisplay multiple tours again. 
    This bug is available since the beginning of selecting multiple 
    tours
  - Sometimes selected tour(s) are not displayed because the internal 
    visible state was not correctly set


* Tour Editor

  - Fixed Linux async problem: modify flag is set when opening a 
    tour/event


Tour Import
===========

* .fit File

  - Fixed NPE when a lap has not an absolute time, this occured with 
    files from Sigma-ROX 12.0

* .gpx File

  - "Convert waypoints into tour markers" did not work
  - Set correct marker position when waypoint is converted into tour 
    marker

* Set speed from device by discovering any time slices and not only the 
  first


Join Tours
==========

* Set speed from device according to the joined tours
