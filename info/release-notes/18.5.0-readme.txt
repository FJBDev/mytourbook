* Compare Tours by Geo Location (GPS)

  Tours can now be compared by using it's geo data.
  Comparing tours by it's altitude data still works.

  Geo comparing is currently EXPERIMENTAL !


Improvements
============	

* 2D Map

  - Sync map with both chart sliders and center the map between the 
    sliders
  - Show/hide tour color actions


* 2D Map Options

  - Show a line between both chart sliders
  - Zoom + center with the mouse position
  - Set opacity for the tour track

    This opacity can reduce performance significantly !
