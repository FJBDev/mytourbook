Version 16.7                                                ?. July 2016

New 	
===

* Statistics

  - Day summary statistics
    - New graphs for average speed/pace (the values are stacked for the 
      same day, this can maybe improved)
    - Select visible graphs in the options slideout

  - Select chart grid options in the options slideout and set the 
    options for each chart individually

  - Select tour frequency options in the options slideout
    (these options are removed now from the preference dialog)

  - Order bar sequence for month/year statistics

  - Sort statistics sequence by data/time (in the preference dialog)


  When MyTourbook is opened with version 16.7 then the "old" statistic 
  view is not displayed any more.

  To open the "new" statistic view, select Directory / Statistics in 
  the app menu.

  This is because of some internal changes, all features are still 
  available + new features.


* Heart Rate Variability

  - This is a new view, it requires heart rate time data 
    (R-R time in ms)

 
Improvements 	
============

* Map

  - Keep map position when a tour is saved, e.g. setting the tour marker 
    position in the tour chart (which also saves the tour).

 

* Icons

  - A few icons changed

 
Bugfix 	
======

* Statistics

  - All views are not updated when a tour is deleted,
    this was introduced when the tour log view is logging tour deletions

  - Tour frequency statistic is wrong when stacked bars are displayed
