Improvements
============

* Flat Tour Book View
  - Show markers and tags columns with the correct content (no dummy text)
  
* Tour Tag Filter
  - Tags can be combined also with AND, so a tour will only be displayed when it contain ALL selected tags. 
    In the previous version, tags were combined with OR, so a tour was displayed when it contained ONE of the selected tags.
