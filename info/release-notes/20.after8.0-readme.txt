Issues
======


New
===

* Elapsed Time - Recorded Time - Paused Time (Frederic) https://github.com/wolfgang-ch/mytourbook/pull/222
 
  Device time, when the user pressed start/stop/pause:
  - Elapsed time (formerly Recording Time)
  - Recorded Time
  - Paused Time (= Elapsed Time - Recorded Time)

  Computed time is dependend on the break time algorithm (existing time data):
  - Moving Time
  - Break Time ( = Elapsed Time - Moving Time)
    
  - The recorded/paused time are imported from the following formats Garmin FIT, Suunto (Ambit 2 xml, Ambit 2 sml, Suunto Spartan/9 .json.gz), SportTracks Fitlog, Garmin TCX
  - Added the ability to re-import, for existing tours, only the timer pauses (and hence also the recorded time).
  - The new tour times (Recorded & Paused Times) are available for display in the TourDataEditorView, TourBookView, Calendar view & Statistics View
  - 2D Map: Added the ability to display/hide the location and duration of the tour pauses

* Statistic Values View
  - Displays the values of the statistic graphs
  - Statistic values can be copied in csv format to the clipboard
  - Displays athlete's data (body weight and fat) for any given day/week/month/year

* Tour Editor (Frederic)
  - Added a body fat percentage field in the Personal Details section

* Geo Compare View (Frederic)
  - Added a relative geo differences filter to only display the compared tours for which the relative geo difference is under that threshold (see feature request https://sourceforge.net/p/mytourbook/feature-requests/183/)

* Import Magellan/Mio Cyclo 105 *.act Files (Frederic) https://github.com/wolfgang-ch/mytourbook/pull/219


Improvements
============

* Improved Cadence Support (rtdog)
  - Added new cadence type "none" for tours with no cadence
  - Added default cadence assignment during Easy Import Launcher when setting tour type
  - Created import preference for default cadence to use during import launcher configuration
  - Added language support for cadence type names (none/rpm/spm)

* Flat Tour Book View
  - Sort also by
    - Computed break time
  - Show markers and tags columns with the saved content (no dummy text)
  
* Tour Book View
  - Reimport keeps manually selected paths during a session and tries to reuse it for subsequent files when necessary.

* Calendar View
  - New toolbar action: Go to today

* Statistics View
  - New toolbar action: Copy statistic values to the clipboard
  - Show total/percentage values in the tooltip - https://sourceforge.net/p/mytourbook/feature-requests/180/
  - Statistic tooltip values (a summary of tours) can be formatted differently compared with tour tooltip values

* Geo Compare View (Frederic)
  - Added the recorded time column
  - Added the Average Pace column
  
* Tour Tag Filter
  - Tags can also be combined with AND, so a tour will only be displayed when it contain ALL selected tags. 
    In the previous version, tags were combined with OR, so a tour was displayed when it contained ONE of the selected tags. 
  - Unchecked tags in the "Selected Tags" list will also be saved in the tag filter profile, in the previous version they got lost.
    These unchecked tags can be deleted with the DELETE key in the "Selected Tags" or by unchecking it in "Available Tags"

* Dialog Adjust Elevation
  - Adjustment Type: "Approach elevation with SRTM data"
    New action: "Set last point to SRTM elevation", this sets the elevation of the horizontally most right point to it's SRTM elevation value

* Dropbox (Frederic)
  - Dropbox file/folder dialog: Sorting alphabetically the Dropbox folders and files

* Tour re-import(Frederic)
  - Added a contextual menu "Reimport Tours..." to give the ability to select several data to re-import for selected tours or all tours in the database
  - When re-importing data, the previous and current data is displayed (whenever possible) in the Log view to show the users the differences before and after the re-import
  - Added the ability for the user to skip a file if the filepath is unknown or not found
  - Correct the import filepath location (Wolfgang)
  - Re-import tours between two dates (Wolfgang)
