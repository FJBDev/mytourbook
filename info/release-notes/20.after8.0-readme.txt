TODO's
======  
* Do not autodelete "Selected Tags" in tour tag filter when they are not checked 

New
===

* Elapsed Time - Recorded Time - Paused Time (Frederic) https://github.com/wolfgang-ch/mytourbook/pull/2XX
 - The recorded/paused time are imported from the following formats Garmin FIT, Suunto (Ambit 2 xml, Ambit 2 sml, Suunto Spartan/9 .json.gz), SportTracks Fitlog, Garmin TCX
 - Added the ability to re-import, for existing tours, only the timer pauses (and hence also the recorded time).
 - The new tour times (Recorded & Paused Times) are available for displau in the TourDataEditorView, TourBookView, Calendar view & Statistics View
 - 2D Maps: Added the ability to display/hide the location and duration of the tour pauses


Improvements
============

* Flat Tour Book View
  - Show markers and tags columns with the correct content (no dummy text)
  
* Tour Tag Filter
  - Tags can be combined also with AND, so a tour will only be displayed when it contain ALL selected tags. 
    In the previous version, tags were combined with OR, so a tour was displayed when it contained ONE of the selected tags.
