Update to Eclipse 4.12 to fix an issue
 
Update Docu

  - Map provider slideout
    
    - 3 state column sorting: ascending/descending/manual with drag & drop

* Weather (need to purchase an API Key) (Frederic)
  - Added the ability to retrieve the weather data that occured during a given
    tour (using the WorldWeatherOnline API). The following data will be set in
    the tour :
    - Label containing the weather description
    - Wind speed
    - Wind direction
    - Average Temperature
    - Wind Chill 
    - Max Temperature
    - Min Temperature
    - Humidity
    - Precipitation
    - Clouds

  - Moved from 8 cardinals to 16 cardinals wind direction

  - The user can choose to activate the weather retrieval in the easy import config
