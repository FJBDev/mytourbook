Version 17.4                                              14. April 2017

New 	
===

* Tour Filter

Tours can be filtered by

  - Person
  - Tour type
  - Tour photo
  - Tour fields (this is new)


Problem with Linux
------------------
When the calendar area of a date widget in a filter property is hovered 
with the mouse and the calendar area is outside of the slideout border, 
then the calendar area will be closed.

Workarounds
-----------
  - Enlarge the slideout
  - Enter date with keyboard (old school)

Background
----------
Linux creates a shell for each date widget and this shell cannot be 
easily controled from outside of the widget.

The date widget is differently implemented in Windows which do not have 
this issue.

 
Improvements 	
============

* Statistics

  - Show number of tours in week/month/year summary
  - Select statistics which should be displayed in the week/month/year 
    summary
  - Select bar chart type for week/month/year summary
    - Adjacent
    - Stacked
  - Show/hide year separator in month/year summary

 
Bugfix 	
======

* Slideout dialog
  Selecting an item in a combobox list has closed the slideout, this 
  problem existed since the beginning of using slideouts
 
* GPX import
  Tolerate "version=1.1" without namespace

* Tour search
  Error occured in the search tour URI when the app folder path 
  contained square brackets, e.g [16.11]

 
System 	
======

* SRTM
  Replaced defaults for the SRTM3 server 
  https://dds.cr.usgs.gov/srtm/version2_1

  SRTM data must use https
  ------------------------
  http is not working any more to load SRTM data.
  When MyTourbook was used before, this must be changed manually in the 
  preferences.


* FIT SDK
  Updated to newest version 20.27 which fixed this problem
