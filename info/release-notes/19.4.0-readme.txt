Important Infos
===============

* .fit Import

  The .fit file importer is simplified/restructured to fix an issue. 
  Afterwards it was tested with several different .fit files.

  It is still possible that there are undiscovered issues. So check your 
  tour data after the next imports to ensure that all values are 
  available and valid.
