* Running Cadence

  The runners cadence is twice the cycling cadence, with this new 
  feature, runners must not multiply anymore their cadence values.

  - Cadence values are multiplied with the new cadence factor, it is
    1.0 ... Revolutions per minute (rpm)
    2.0 ... Steps per minute (spm)
  - The cadence factor is set to 2 when a stride sensor is detected in 
    a .fit import
  - Stride sensor state is displayed in the tour editor info tab

 
* Select Value Format

  Sometimes less digits are better than more. How date and number values
  are displayed can be selected.

 
* Adjust Tour Start Temperature Values

  During the winter season, the sportcomputer device needs some time to 
  adjust to the environment temperature when it's moved outdoors, this 
  tool can correct wrong temperature values.
