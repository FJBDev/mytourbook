* 2.5D Map Issues

 This map has still some issues, it is not yet working perfectly but it 
 will not damaging your data

 Flickering
 The 2.5D map could be flickering when moving the mouse and using a 
 NVIDIA graphics card.

 This problem can be solved by setting the 'Buffer-flipping mode' to 
 'Use block transfer' in the NVIDIA Control Panel, this is also 
 documented here https://github.com/mapsforge/vtm/issues/257

 
Artwork
=======	

* App Icons

  - Recreated more than 100 icons


* Tour Type Icon 

  Uncluttered design

  - Paint with fill color, gradient color is disable
  - Fill color is computed as an average of the gradient bright and 
    gradient dark color
  - Top and bottom borders are disabled
  - Left and right border width changed from 2px to 1 px


* Design Guidelines

  These are the main guidelines which were applied to the new icons:

  - Max 2 different color, a bright/dark color is 1 color
  - Dark outlines but only when necessary to unclutter the design
