Bugfix
======

* FIT Import
  Fixed NPE when importing Orux FIT files

* Week of Year
  Old versions of MyTourbook created a wrong value for week of year. 
  This problem can be fixed by running the action 'Update calendar week 
  in all tours' in the preferences 'General/Calendar Week'
  
* Fixed org.hibernate.PersistentObjectException 
  This occured when 
  - Import gpx file 
  - Multiple tours and waypoints in one file 
  - All tours are not merged into a single tour, this is the default 
    setting
  - Saving the tours
  
* Fixed some out of bounds exceptions when multiple, only manually 
  created tours are selected
