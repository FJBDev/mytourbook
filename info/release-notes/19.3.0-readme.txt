Version 19.3.0                                             1. March 2019


32 Bit Platforms are dropped
============================

Why ?

There was the problem that the preference dialog took a very long time 
(minutes) to open it with Linux.

This issue has been fixed in Eclipse 4.9. However, to use the latest 
official version of Eclipse 4.10, this version is now used, but it only
supports the 64 bit platforms

-> MyTourbook now only support the 64 bit platforms


Improvements   
============

* Search Tour by Location

  - Scroll map when mouse is near the map border, this feature has 
    issues when selecting a rectangle

 
Bugfix   
======

* Easy Import Dialog

  - Dialog did not open after 1 item was created, this occured only with
    Linux

 
* System

 - Fixed sql exception when primary key already exists, this was the
   reason why version 19.2 was removed

 
System   
======

* Eclipse 4.10 64 bit
