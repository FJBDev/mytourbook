21.next.0                                                 ?. Month 2021


TODO's
======

* Website: Document cloud connections

  @wolfgang-ch In the Strava guidelines, I read this : https://developers.strava.com/guidelines/
  "All apps must display the “Powered by Strava” logo or “Compatible with Strava” logo on all websites, apps and any distributable media such as images, videos or prints. No variations or modifications are acceptable."

  I am thinking you could display the logo "Compatible With Strava" on the website in the next release and that would comply with their requirements ?

* Website: Map providers list in https://osmlab.github.io/editor-layer-index/

* Frederic : Remove the unused redirect_uri in the Dropbox app console once the new version is released

New
===

* Strava Integration (Frederic) https://github.com/wolfgang-ch/mytourbook/pull/273
  - Ability to upload tours to a Strava account.


* Compress Database
  This tool can compress the internal sql database. After updating MyTourbook to 21.2, the latitude/longitude values are saved with half of the previous size. This reduced the diskspace by e.g. 110 MByte when the database was compressed after the migration.

Improvements
============

* 


Changes  
=======

* Dropbox Integration (Frederic) https://github.com/wolfgang-ch/mytourbook/pull/277
  - Switched to the new PKCE OAuth2 flow (The Implicit grant flow previously used is now considered deprecated by Dropbox: "[Legacy. We recommend the PKCE flow.]")
  - Because Dropbox doesn't support Web Views, the authorization is now done in the user's default browser. See the PR link for the details about the new authorization steps

* Latitude/longitude values are saved in E6 format
  This reduces the precision in the worst case (at the equator) to 0.11132m which is less than the accuracy of the GPS system
