TODOs

New + Improvements
==================

* Tour Tag View
  - Show tags of all selected tours
  - Add/delete tags of all selected tours
  - Delete tour tag -> tag is removed from tours and tag definition is deleted
  - Delete tour tag category

* Tagged Tours
  - Expand/collapse tag/tag category/year/month (item) when label is selected with the mouse
  - Expand only one item and collapse any other items

* Tour cadence zones times (Frederic)
  - Added the ability to see, for a given activity, month or year, the
    percentage of time spent in each cadence zone "slow" and "fast".
    This feature was inspired by coach Jason Koop's recommendation (see bullet
    point #5 "Hike more"
    https://trainright.com/8-things-ultrarunners-do-improve-training/)

* Tour Marker's view (Frederic)
 - Possibility to delete marker(s) from the contextual menu and when pressing
   the DELETE key

* Tour Chart
  - New smoothing algorithm which is not smoothing the computed speed/pace/altimeter/gradient values, this allows to see the raw computed data.
 
* Tour Editor
  - Tour can be saved with <Ctrl>+s when "Tour Editor" view is the active view
  - The save and new tour actions are removed from the view toolbar, now they are available in the main toolbar

  - Set min/max temperature values from time slices
  - Show tour start/end location

* Fitlog Import + Tour Book View
  The tour start time was wrong and needed these 2 fixes
  - Fitlog Import
    - Fixed tour start time year/month/day by using it's time zone
  - Tour Book View
    - Extended "Set Time Zone" wizard to set tour start time year/month/day with time zone  
    
* Tour Chart
  - Imperial altitude/altimeter values could be wrong depending on the selected measurement system and when the tour was displayed the first time
  - When multiple tours are displayed and some of the tours have no distance, then the line graph was painted to x=0 which was showing a corrupted graph with triangles
  - Show RPM/SPM correctly in the valuepoint tooltip https://github.com/wolfgang-ch/mytourbook/issues/86


Translation    
===========

 - French (Frederic)
 - German
 - Italian (Doriano)

 
 
System   
======

* Eclipse 2019-09 (4.13)

  - This new version solves the issue (Linux only) when modifying the tour
    start time spinner widget in the tour editor as it was not triggering 
    the possibility to save the tour in the tour editor
    (see also https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=547489)
