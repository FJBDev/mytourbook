TODOs

* Recommend DBeaver as a better SQL explorer   


New + Improvements
==================

* Tour Tag View
  - Show tags of all selected tours
  - Add/delete tags of all selected tours
  - Delete tour tag -> tag is removed from tours and tag definition is deleted
  - Delete tour tag category

* Tagged Tours
  - Expand/collapse tag/tag category/year/month (item) when label is selected with the mouse
  - Expand only one item and collapse any other items

* Tour cadence zones times (Frederic)
  - Added the ability to see, for a given activity, month or year, the
    percentage of time spent in each cadence zone "slow" and "fast".
    This feature was inspired by coach Jason Koop's recommendation (see bullet
    point #5 "Hike more"
    https://trainright.com/8-things-ultrarunners-do-improve-training/)

* Average elevation change per unit of distance (Frederic)
  - Added the ability to see (in the Tour Book View and Calendar profiles) for a given
    activity, month or year, the average elevation change per unit of distance.
    This feature was inspired by coach Jason Koop's recommendation (see bullet
    point "Volume of vertical gain/loss"
    https://trainright.com/data-worth-tracking-ultrarunners)

* Tour Marker's view (Frederic)
 - Possibility to delete marker(s) from the contextual menu and when pressing
   the DELETE key

* Tour Chart
  - New smoothing algorithm which is not smoothing the computed speed/pace/altimeter/gradient values, this allows to see the raw computed data.
 
* Tour Editor
  - Tour can be saved with <Ctrl>+s when "Tour Editor" view is the active view
  - The save and new tour actions are removed from the view toolbar, now they are available in the main toolbar

* Tour Book View
  - Show min/max temperature values
  - Set min/max temperature values from time slices
  - Show tour start/end location

* Tour Filter
  - Filter by tour start/end location

    format. 
	By default, the Strava and Garmin activity types are proposed
    (see https://developers.strava.com/docs/uploads/ and https://www8.garmin.com/xmlschemas/TrainingCenterDatabasev2.xsd)
  
* Dialog Quick Edit
  - Edit tour start/end location

Import
======

  - Added the ability to choose whether to set the person's body weight when
    importing and saving a tour.

* Import FitLogEx Files (Frederic)
  - Custom Data Field Import. The data field names and values are imported in
    the tour notes
  - Setting the start time (when present) and time zone (when GPS coordinates are not present)

* .fit File (Frederic)
  - Added support for the developer field:
    - Garmin Running Dynamics Pod
  - Added the ability to select the preferred power developer field to import
  - when multiple power data sources are present within a given FIT file:
    - Stryd or Garmin Running Dynamics Pod

* .tcx File
  - Import Course/Name tag as tour title


Changes
=======

* Altitude -> Elevation
  - Changed wording from "Altitude" to "Elevation" for the english texts
    The term elevation is mainly used when referring to points on the Earth's surface, while altitude (...) is used for points above the surface
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevation

* Tour Book View
  -  Moved all tour modify actions into the new submenu "Adjust Tour Values"


Bugfix   
======

* Weather (Frederic)
 - When entering a pressure using the metric system (mb), the format now accepts 1
   decimal

* Fitlog Import (Frederic)
  - Now Taking into account the pauses when importing laps 
  - Distinguishing between manual activities and activities with tracks 
  - Converting Calories (unit used in ST) to kilocalories (unit used in MTB)

* Body Weight unit (Frederic)
  - When changing the measurement unit, the body weight unit is updated in the UI

* Fitlog Import + Tour Book View
  The tour start time was wrong and needed these 2 fixes
  - Fitlog Import
    - Fixed tour start time year/month/day by using it's time zone
  - Tour Book View
    - Extended "Set Time Zone" wizard to set tour start time year/month/day with time zone  
 
* CM4xxM Import (Meinhard)
  - Fixed endless loop when reading a CM4xxM DAT file https://github.com/wolfgang-ch/mytourbook/issues/125 
    
* Tour Chart
  - Imperial altitude/altimeter values could be wrong depending on the selected measurement system and when the tour was displayed the first time
  - When multiple tours are displayed and some of the tours have no distance, then the line graph was painted to x=0 which was showing a corrupted graph with triangles
  - Show RPM/SPM correctly in the valuepoint tooltip https://github.com/wolfgang-ch/mytourbook/issues/86

* Import
  - Fixed a bug that confused the user when re-importing multiple files. If one of them was invalid,
    the log would display the valid re-imported files as invalid files that could not be re-imported

  - Fixed a bug when reimporting a subset of tours contained in files that have multiple tours.
    The reimport is now enabled for all files except .Fit files.

System   
======

* Eclipse 2019-09 (4.13)

    start time spinner widget in the tour editor as it was not triggering 
    the possibility to save the tour in the tour editor
    (see also https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=547489)
