translate: "Search for places and show them on the map"
messages editor bug: you can switch between the Messages Editor UI with multiple languages (1st tab) at once or the language tabs (2nd ...) 
don't edit at both places -> you will loose your modifications
switching the displayed languages, close the editor otherwise is raises an dispose error

webbsite:
- update java code formatting on website
- translate installer
- translation tip: </ a> do not create an link, </a> is OK
- 40-50h translation

recommendation:
- use KatMouse on windows

Fixed bugs 	
    fixed bug to auto open tag menu in OSX, eclipse 3.7 is required
    hide tour tooltip when "Add Tag" context menu is displayed
    Fitlog-Import fails for tracks without GPS data - ID: 3232030
    Conconi test window broke workbench - ID: 3269916
    moving-, paused- and reording-time, can't be greater than 9.
    Bug was only observed on Mac OSX, works fine on windows
    values for graphs in the chart has been clipped at the canvas border
        -> painting on the vertical border was wrong
        -> bugfix required a new painting strategy for all charts
