New 	
 

3D map has been improved and can show tours now but all 2D map features 
are not yet implemented. However, this map do contain features which are 
not available in the 2D map, e.g. select a tour. 

* Show tour tracks with different color profiles, 
  e.g. Altitude, Speed, Pulse, ... 

* The context menu provides different tools for a selected tour, 
  e.g. Adjust Altitude. 

* Customize track properties (color, size, ...). 

* 3D Tips. 

   

Mac OS X Problem 


It is possible that this version will not run properly on OS X. It can 
happen that the icon for the 3D map appears 2x times and they are 
disabled. 

To solve this problem do an application cleanup as it is described here 
and reinstall the application. You will not loose your data but a backup 
is always a good idea. 



Linux + Mac OS X Problem 


The tour legend in the 3D map looks ugly on Linux and OS X. 

It was a last minute action (even it took several hours to implement it) 
before the product for this app was created and it was not tested on 
Linux + Mac but was running (almost) smoothly on Windows. 

Just disable the legend (in the context menu) when you don't like it, it 
will be improved in the next version but not now.
