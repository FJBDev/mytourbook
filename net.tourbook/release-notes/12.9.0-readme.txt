When tour is not found, possible reasons can be:
- selected tour person
- selected tour type
- is ONE history tour selected

Which photos are displayed in the Tour Map view, depend on which view is active and which photos/tours are selected in this view. 
This behaviour is very flexible but can confuse the user.

TIPs
Take a picture from a radio controlled watch, then it's easy to adjust time for taken photos because a GPS device has also a radio controlled time

Photo News

* show tour photos in the tour chart
  - show hovered photos in a photo tooltip

* in the full screen image viewer a photo gallery can be displayed for all available photos, just move mouse to the top of the screen


Other News

* when the tour chart is zoomed in, 2 markers shows how far the chart is moved to the right or left side
* spanish translation, provided by Pedro Merino Laso


Improvements 

* set tour marker visibility (can be used when doing a screenshot to hide awkward markers)
* 2 markers in the tour chart axis shows how far to the right or left a zoomed chart is moved


Different behaviour:

* UPDATE DOCU: TOUR CHART autoscrolling in the tour chart can be done only, when the mouse vertical position is below the horizontal x-axis of the lower graph (when multiple graphs are displayed)


Odd things:

* 6 minutes and 32 seconds are skipped in the German time zone at 1 April 1893

Fixed Bugs 

* just detected (24.9.2012), that power & speed series from a device are not transferred correctly when upgrading version 11.8 to 12.1, values are too small. This bug has been fixed, when version 12.1 or later is not yet used, the data transfer is done now correctly. However when version 12.1 or later is already use, the tour data must be reimported. This can be done in the import view with this action in the context menu: Tour Reimport/All Time Slice Values. This bug mainly occures for tours which are recorded from an ergometer because it is recording power & speed.


Development

* restructured plugins: removed net.tourbook.util, added net.tourbook.common


System 

* Eclipse 3.8.1
