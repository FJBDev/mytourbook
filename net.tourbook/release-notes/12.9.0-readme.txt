When tour is not found, possible reasons can be:
- selected tour person
- selected tour type
- is ONE history tour selected

Which photos are displayed in the Tour Map view, depend on which view is active and which photos/tours are selected in this view. 
This behaviour is very flexible but can confuse the user.

TIPs
Take a picture from a radio controlled watch, then it's easy to adjust time for taken photos because a GPS device has also a radio controlled time
