Version: 14.x.0                                       ?. ? 2014


HINT for docu
Delete 3D map images in C:\ProgramData\WorldWindData\Earth\... because it is possible that newer images are available are not downloaded because they are cached in these folders.


INFO
An error can occure when MT (or a perspective) is opened the first time after installing this version. The reason is that the "3D Map Layer" view is not available any more as an Eclipse view, now it's displayed as a slideout which is not an Eclipse view. This was done to have a consistent UI with slideouts to configure the 3D map.

TIP
Improve performance by disabling layers, e.g. "Bing Imagery" and "MS Virtual Earth Areal", these layers can slow down the map drawing.

New 3D Map Features 	

* 

* 

* 

* Converted layer view into a slideout.

 

Other New Features	

* Restructured creation of the tour id for ALL supported tour import formats. A tour id can now be created with/without tour distance (default is without). This feature allows, to save the same tour twice.

VERY IMPORTANT
The algorithm to import any supported data formats have been changed. Please report a bug when tours are imported and could be saved twice when it should not.
For .fit formatted data files, it is possible, that the same tour can be imported 3 times, 1x with the previous versions of MyTourbook and 2x with the new version.
I'm not happy with this problem, the old implementation used a wrong algorithm to create the tour id.
