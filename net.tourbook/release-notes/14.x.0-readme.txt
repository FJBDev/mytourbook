Version: 14.x.0                                       ?. ? 2014


HINT for docu
Delete 3D map images in C:\ProgramData\WorldWindData\Earth\... because it is possible that newer images are available are not downloaded because they are cached in these folders.


INFO
An error can occure when MT (or a perspective) is opened the first time after installing this version. The reason is that the "3D Map Layer" view is not available any more as an Eclipse view, now it's displayed as a slideout which is not an Eclipse view. This was done to have a consistent UI with slideouts to configure the 3D map.

TIP
Improve performance by disabling layers, e.g. "Bing Imagery" and "MS Virtual Earth Areal", these layers can slow down the map drawing.

* Restructured creation of the tour id for ALL supported tour import formats. A tour id can be created with/without tour distance, this allows to save the same tour twice.

INFO: The algorithm to import any supported data formats have been changed. Please report a bug when tours are imported and saved twice when it should not.
