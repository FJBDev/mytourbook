TOUR CHART MODIFIED !!!

New
===

* Tour Chart
- Show/navigate multiple tours.
- Title for each tour.
  - Tour tooltip when hovered with mouse.
  - Select tour with single click.
  - Quick edit tour with double click.
- Customize tour info.
- Customize segment color.
- Zoom marker: show relative position value when zoomed in.
- Show only tour marker which contain a description.
- HR zones can only be displayed for multiple tours when an active person is selected, it is not available when 'All People' is selected.
- Zoom in/out with smaller steps when <Alt> key is pressed.


Improvements
============	

* FIT Import
- Ignore tour markers at the end of the tour, can be configured in the Fit pref pages.
- Replace time slices when it exceeds a selected duration.
  This fixes a device bug because the .fit file contained a time slice with more than 17 years.

* Reimport
- Only tour markers.
- Only power and speed values.

* Map2
- Draw map scale with rounded units and without black/white color (I always puzzled how to interpret the scale colors).
- Prevent redrawing for multiple tours.
- Center map with both sliders, e.g. when a segment or multiple segments are selected in the tour segmenter. This solved a very long annoying behaviour.

* Tour Editor
- Customize number of displayed digits for the lat/lon column values.

* Tour Segmenter
- Properties (value, font, opacity ...) how segments are displayed in the tour chart.
- Select tour segments with the mouse in the tour chart, multiple segments can be selected with the <Shift> key.
 
Bugfix

* Photo
- Fixed ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException when tour contains only 1 time slice.
