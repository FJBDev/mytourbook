Version: 13.4.1                                           ?. April 2013


New


* Change image folder for a tour photo, with this limits:

- !!! This feature is not available when an image is displayed in an image gallery tooltip !!!

- The image location is saved in the tour with the platform specific structure, therefore the tour images are not displayed, when the tour database is moved to another platform, c:\ != /home/user

- Folder replacement can be done only for images in ONE foler and not for a selected image, subfolders are also ignored.


Fixed Bugs 

* When a tour is split, these error occured:

- A tour marker can be out of array bounds.

- NPE occured when last time slice is split


* Show photo annotations at the correct position when image cannot be loaded
