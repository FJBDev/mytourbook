Version: 13.??.0                                           ?. ??? 2013 


Detected Problems:

* photo gallery in the tour marker dialog box it not correctly initialized, state is not set
* tooltip flickering occures only with bad display drivers !!!


Improvements


Photos + Tours view

* save photos in tour

* show number of saved photos including time adjustment

* new filter to show only tours which contain photos but the photos are not yet saved in the tour


Tour Chart view

* show/hide photo markers with/without photo tooltip

* show different photo markers for linked and saved photos 
  !!! there is a different hovering algorithm for the mouse location and photo group background color !!!


Tour Map view

* filter photos by rating stars

* set photo image size


All photo galleries

* star rating can be set for photos when they are saved in a tour. When a photo is set in multiple tours, star rating can currently not be set (I hope this happens not too often)


Fixed bugs

* all average values in the tour book view are wrong, they included tours which values are not set -> average values are too small, http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&atid=890604&aid=3599360&group_id=179799
