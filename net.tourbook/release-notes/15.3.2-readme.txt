Version 15.3.2                                             7. April 2015

New 	
===

* Tour Segmenter

The new tour segmenter "By Altitude (with DB) - merged" creates the same
segments compared with the segmeter "By Altitude (with DB)", however the 
new segmenter will merge all consecutive up and down values into one 
segment which makes it easier to see the segments in the tour segmenter 
view or in the tour chart.

The idea for this new segmenter came spontaneous but I'm wondering why 
it came not some years earlier.


Improvements
============

* Tour Segmenter
  Preserve selected tour segmenter when this view is closed and reopened.
