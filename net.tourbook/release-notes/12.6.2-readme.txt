Fixed Bugs 

* training view has not displayed all available pulse data

This is an example for 2 pulse zones when bug occured:

1st zone ends at 142, 2nd zone starts at 143, all values between 142 and 
143 are ignored when pulse values contain fractional digits

To update existing tours with this bugfix (statistic views can be wrong), press button "Compute HR Zones..." in the preference dialog People/Tab:Heartrate Zones

 
* training view has not displayed modifications in the smoothing 
algorithm
