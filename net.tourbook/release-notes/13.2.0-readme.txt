Version: 13.2.0                                        6. February 2013


New Features 	

* Photo workflow is now complete.

It took 12 months to implement this simple feature: "Show tour photos in 
the map" and there are still some parts which can be improved. 


* Tour Photo Filter

- when this filter is activated, only tours with photos will be 
displayed. This affects ALL views, special views are excluded, e.g. tour 
import view. 


* Photos + Tours view 

- save photos in a tour, when a tour contains photos, they can be 
displayed in the tour chart, tour map and tour photo views 

- displays number of saved photos and time adjustment 

- new filter to show only tours which contain photos but the photos are 
not yet saved in a tour 


* Tour Chart view 

- show/hide photo markers with/without photo tooltip 

- show different photo markers for linked and saved photos 


* Tour Map view 

- filter photos by rating stars 

- set photo image size 

- Problem: sometimes photos are not displayed, because they are not yet 
loaded, selecting another tour and reselecting the previous tour will 
solve it. This problem will be fixed in the next major version. 


* All photo galleries

- star rating can be set for photos when they are saved in a tour. When 
a photo is saved in multiple tours, star rating can currently not be set 
(this situation can occure when more than one person is saving the same 
photo) 

 

Behaviour changed
	
* Tour Chart view

- there is a different hovering algorithm for the mouse location and 
photo marker background color 

 

Fixed Bugs 	

* Tour Book view
 - all average values are wrong, they included tours which values are 
not set -> average values are too small 3599360
