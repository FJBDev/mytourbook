Version: 13.4.1                                           29. April 2013 

 
New 

* Change tour photo image location. 


Fixed Bugs 

* A splitted tour can cause these errors: 

- A tour marker can be out of array bounds. 

- NPE occured when last time slice is split. 


* Show photo annotations at the correct position when images cannot be 
loaded. 


* Experience with 3D Map & Linux 

In the release notes of version 13.4 it was written that Linux can crash 
using the new 3D map. This is still true but it also depends on the used 
graphic card. 

When having a computer (notebook) with an onboard and a 2nd graphic 
card, it can work successfully with the onboard graphic card but it can 
crash with the 2nd graphic card.
