Version: 14.4.0                                           11. April 2014




System 


* Java 7 is the new required platform. 

This should not be a problem because Java 6 is outdated but not yet 
fully buried.



New 3D Map Features 	


* 3D Map Layer view 3D Map Layer is converted into a slideout. 
 
When this error "Problems occurered restoring perspective" is displayed 
after starting version 14.4, just ignore it. It is displayed only the 
first time when a perspective is restored. 

This error can occure when the 3D Map Layer view was visible or hidden 
before version 14.4 was installed. This view is now removed and replaced 
with the slideout. 


* Set layer opacity. 


* Draw a line from a slider (left/right/hovered) to the surface. This 
simple feature took me 3 weeks to implement it but it also helped me, to 
unterstand a little bit more of OpenGL. 



New 


* Patch from 17. February 2014 

Import power and speed data from .tcx files when the data are enclosed 
in these tags: <ns3:Speed> <ns3:Watts> 


* Patch from 5. March 2014 

Import cadence and heartrate data from .gpx files when the data are 
enclosed in these tags: <cadence> <heartrate> 



Improvements 


* The same tour can now be imported two times. 

This modification required a restructuring of the tour id creation for 
ALL supported import formats, see here for more details. 

VERY IMPORTANT 

.fit data files 

Imported and saved .fit files from previous versions (14.2 and older) 
are not recognized as already saved tours, because the old 
implementation used a wrong algorithm to create the tour id. The import 
of .fit files with the current version 14.4 and future versions of 
MyTourbook will create a different tour id. 

Already imported and saved .fit tours work as before, it's just the 
creation (and first save) of a tour which creates the tour id. 

So, please take care when you try to import already saved .fit tours 
because the Database Status column (first column) in the import view do 
not display the correct state. 

Other data file formats 

It's possible that other data file formats can have the same problem 
like the .fit files. 

During my testing this problem occured when a tour contained only a few 
(e.g. 2) timeslices or had other issues. 

The Database Status of regular tours should be displayed correctly. 



Fixed Bugs 


* Fixed bug in TCX import when <DistanceMeters> is < 0.
