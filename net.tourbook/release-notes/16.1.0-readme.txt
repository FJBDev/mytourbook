Version 16.1                                            18. January 2016

New
===	

* Tour Import

  - New dashboard
  - The old import page is displayed as default


* Tour Log

  - Show tour logs


This version is almost the same as 15.12 Experimental III, the only 
difference is, that the tour import is still usable when the embedded 
browser in the import dashboard crashes, in this case it shows the old 
import UI (after a restart :-)
 

Bugfix
======	

* Tour Type Color

  - Fixed historic bug: Modified colors of a tour type were not display
    until the pref dialog was reopened


System
======	

* Java 8

  - Java 8 is required to run this application
