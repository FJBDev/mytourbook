New 3D Map Features 	

* Map is positioned with a selected tour marker in the tour chart.


New 

* Improved tour marker dialog

- Restructured UI.
- Select a marker in the tour chart graphic.
- A moving slider in the tour chart is also moved in an opened 2D/3D map view. 
This is not the best solution but much better than before. It's a compromise because implementing a map within the marker dialog is very very time consuming. The 2D/3D maps are tight very closely to the 2D/3D map views. This implementation needed only 1h. 
This missing feature was annoying the author since a very long time :-)


* Tour chart

- Slideout to set tour marker display options.
- Doubleclick a tour marker will open the marker dialog.
- Display a tour marker icon
- Context menu for a marker
  + Edit marker


* Tagging view

- Keep expanded/collapsed tags/categories when this view is closed and reopened.


Improvements 

* CSV import

- altutide up/down can also be imported
  required header/format: "Date (yyyy-mm-dd); Time (hh-mm); Duration (sec); Paused Time (sec); Distance (m); Title; Comment; Tour Type; Tags; Altitude Up (m); Altitude Down (m);"

* Customize Columns

- columns can be set visible/hidden in the header context menu for all tables/trees which are using the column manager



Changes

* Application menu is restructured.


* Tour Editor

- Removed tour marker tab because it was a redundance of the Tour Marker view which is now improved.


* Workspace

- Removed these actions "Tagged Tour", "Tour Analyzer" and "Tour Segmenter" from the workspace toolbars, these actions are available from the main menu.
