TODO:

* !!! VERY IMPORTANT: DB BACKUP BECAUSE OF STRUCTURAL CHANGES, e.g. dropped unused tables, foreign key

* Workflow how altitude up/down is computed
  - Pref page: computed values
  - Tour segmenter: adjust DP tolerance
  - Dialog: adjust altitude

83 changes


App menu is reorganized, it is possible that the short cuts needs to be adjusted !!!!

A few names has been changed, the old names are deleted so you find them as not translated text, e.g. Tour Catalog -> Reference Tours

New 

* Improved tour marker dialog

- Restructured UI.
- Select a marker in the tour chart graphic.
- A moving slider in the tour chart is also moved in an opened 2D/3D map view. 
This is not the best solution but much better than before. It's a compromise because implementing a map within the marker dialog is very very time consuming. The 2D/3D maps are tight very closely to the 2D/3D map views. This implementation needed only 1h. 
This missing feature was annoying the author since a very long time :-)


* Tour chart

- Slideout to set tour marker display options.
- Doubleclick a tour marker will open the marker dialog.
- Context menu for a marker
  - Edit marker
  - Set label position
  - Hide/unhide marker
  - Delete marker
Performance for these actions:
When a single marker is modified with this context menu, the marker and tour will be saved and all opened views will be updated. This action needs some time, when multiple Markers should be changed it is faster to do it in the tour marker dialog.


New 3D Map Features 	

* Map is positioned with a selected tour marker in the tour chart.


* Tagging view

- Keep expanded/collapsed tags/categories when the view is closed and reopened.



* Elevation Gain
Sometimes totally wrong value :-( depending on the terrain

- Tour segmenter
  - Altitude up/down
  - Segmenter with Douglas Peuker
  - Show altitude difference in tour chart.



Improvements


* Fit import

Fixed problem when importing lap marker, they can have another sequence than older fit formats.


* CSV import

altutide up/down can also be imported, required header/format: 
"Date (yyyy-mm-dd); Time (hh-mm); Duration (sec); Paused Time (sec); Distance (m); Title; Comment; Tour Type; Tags; Altitude Up (m); Altitude Down (m);"


* Customize Columns

- columns can be set visible/hidden in the header context menu for all tables/trees which are using the column manager



Changes

* Application menu and toolbar is restructured.


* Tour Editor

- Removed tour marker tab because it was a redundance of the Tour Marker view which is now improved.


* Workspace

- Removed these actions "Tagged Tour", "Tour Analyzer" and "Tour Segmenter" from the workspace toolbars, these actions are available from the main menu.


* Tour Analyzer

- Removed unnecessary digit values
- Is updated when another tour is selected


Fixed Bugs

* Always


System 

* Removed TourCategory entity, it have never been used.
* Removed some tour database tables which have never been used.
