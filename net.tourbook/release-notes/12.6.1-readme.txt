Version: 12.6.1                                           17. July 2012 


Important !!! 

New behaviour in the import view: All tours will be removed (NOT 
deleted) from this view, when this view or the application is closed. 
The old behaviour can be activated in the view menu by unchecking: 
"Remove all tours from this view when it is closed" 


Improvements 

* using embedded SQL server instead of network based server, the 
application startup is 2 sec faster This setup is now the default, using 
the network SQL server can be activated in the preferences General/Tour 

* better info what's being loaded in photo directory Statusline displays 
a message how many folders are being loaded and each folder displays a 
loading... text 


Fixed Bugs 

* Linux: black background color was painted in a map tile instead of the 
map image when it contained a tour or photo, this bug occured when 
simple painting method was used 

* OS X: it happend that a portrait image is displayed as landscape 
image, this wrong rotation can be disabled in the preferences 
Photo/System 


System 

* Eclipse 3.8
