Version: 12.6.1                                           2?. June 2012 

Important !!!

New behaviour in the import view: All tours will be removed (NOT 
deleted) from this view when view or application is closed. The old 
behaviour can be activated in the view menu by unchecking: "Remove all 
tours from tour import view when view or application is closed" 



New 

 * use embedded SQL server instead of network based server to store tour 
data, the application startup is now 2 sec faster (this is now the 
default setting, using the network sql server can be activated in the 
preferences) 



Improvements 

* statusline displays a message how many folders has to be loaded in the 
photo directory
