* Crash out of the box

  When running 3D map in my Linux environment it causes a lot of problems, native Linux is not yet tested.

  Win 7 and OSX 10.6 are running smoothly (when you have a good graphic card :-)

- MyTourbook can crash when showing "Open Street Map" layer

- causes lot of exception's when showing layers which are drawing map tiles

gov.nasa.worldwind.layers.TextureTile initializeTexture
SEVERE: Exception attempting to read texture file
