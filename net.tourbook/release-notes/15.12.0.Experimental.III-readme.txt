Version 15.12.0 Experimental III                         9. December 2015


New
===	

* Tour Import
  - New dashboard.
  - Delete tour files.
  
  Since Experimental II
  - Device watcher switch 
  
  Since Experimental III
  - Multiple import configurations 
  - Delete device files, this is the same as moving the device files to a backup folder because the delete feature can only be used when also backup files are created.
  - SORRY, I had to change the structure of the easy import configuration and there is no automatic migration, it has to be done manually.
  The old structure can be found in C:\Users\<user>\mytourbook\.metadata\.plugins\net.tourbook\dialog_settings.xml
  in the section "net.tourbook.importdata.EasyImportManager"
  THIS DATA WILL BE OVERWRITTEN WHEN THE NEW VERSION IS USED.

Bugfix
======	

* Tour Type Color
  - Fixed historic bug: Modified colors of a tour type were not display
    until the pref dialog was reopened.



System
======

* Java 8 is required to run this application.

 

Why is this an experimental version?
------------------------------------

In the new dashboard there are 2 hidden tasks which are observing
devices and folders in the filesystem. Because there was no experience
for using this feature, it needs more tests to be sure they are running
flawlessly also with other device configurations.

Testing with Win7 and Ubuntu 14.04 with VMware 12 works now very well
(after many fixes).


This version has some issues but they are non-serious
-----------------------------------------------------

* Import background image can be slow, set opacity to 0 to disable it.
* The embedded browser in Linux cannot show all CSS3 features, e.g.
  background image, gradient, box-shadow is expanding the focus,
  therefore CSS3 is disabled.
* Clicking on the dashboard state icon works sometimes only with the 2nd
  and further clicks.
* The device and backup folders are observed but when these folders
  are deleted/moved this will not be recognized. Workaround: close and
  reopen the import view.
* Disable easy import: Set device folder empty AND deselect create
  backup.
