* Chart + map colors have been reset (because of internal structure changes)
When you have not customized the colors, you don't have to care about the following description.
When you have customized colors, follow these steps to get your old colors back, when you don't do this, you will see the default colors but you can do these steps later because the old color values will not be replaced.
1. move file ...mytourbook\.metadata\.plugins\net.tourbook\legendcolor.xml
  to        ...mytourbook\.metadata\.plugins\net.tourbook.common\legendcolor.xml
		
2. start application
3. make any color change in the preference dialog and press OK (this will force that a new pref file is created)
4. close application
5. copy any lines which are starting with "graph.colors." from the file ...mytourbook\.metadata\.plugins\org.eclipse.core.runtime\.settings\net.tourbook.prefs into the new file (which was created with step 3) ...mytourbook\.metadata\.plugins\org.eclipse.core.runtime\.settings\net.tourbook.common.prefs and replace existing lines which start with "graph.colors."
6. start application

Why is it so complicated?
The colors will also be used in the new 3D map and therefore a restructuring is necessary.
