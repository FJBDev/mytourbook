Improvement 

* Tour Chart 

- Toggle x-axis time between - Recording time (relative time) - Day time 
(absolute time) - Day time with photo time adjustment (this is new) 


Fixed Problems 

* Sort photos correctly in the Tour Photos view when multiple tours are 
selected. 

* Sort tours by date/time when exporting multiple tours. 

* Show photos in the tour map when photos are not yet loaded in other 
views. This implementation is not yet perfect but better than before.
