ExperimentalFeature 

* show photos in the map 

The focal point of this feature is to show photos from a tour in the 
map, it is not planned to replace other sophisticated photo management 
tools 

Until now, the main focus for implementing this feature was the image 
gallery, to display a selected image in the map, was by far the easiest 
task until now, see roadmap for planned features 

This feature currently supports only the English language 


Improvements 

* type-ahead for tour marker labels 

* improved performance for all type-ahead lists, e.g. tour title 

* improved usability by using keyboard shortcuts 

* better resonse time when tours are displayed in the map, especially 
when multiple tours are displayed (tours in the map are now being 
displayed after a map tile has been painted and not after ALL tiles are 
painted) 


Other modifications 

* moved Error Log into Help menu 


Fixed Bugs 

* gpx export: enclosed <time> and <bounds> with <metadata>, provided by

* OS X with Apple mouse: create marker/reference tour in the tour chart 
with the "right" mouse button 

* HR zone statistics have not displayed tours 


System
