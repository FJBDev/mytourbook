Fixed Bugs

features as it was before. POI search is not yet supported for 3D map. 


Crash Stability 

* Crash stability in this version is much better than the previous 
version but it is not yet perfect, crashes still can happen but not very
often, mostly when many tours (hundreds) are displayed. In this version,
the tour rendering was rewritten which helped to reduce crashing.
