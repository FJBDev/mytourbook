Improvements 	
============

* Tour Chart

  - Force min/max values.
    - Force min/max values separately, existing min/max values have been
      reset to default values.
    - Force values for altimeter/gradient/heartbeat/pace.
    - Fixed some bugs when min/max value is enforced.
  - Live update for tour chart preferences.
  - When a vertical slider is moved in the tour chart with a hovered 
    mouse, the tour chart view must not be activated any more (another 
    view can be the active view) that the moved slider is also updated 
    in other views, e.g. 2/3D Map, Tour Analyzer.
  - Removed border line on the left side of the tour chart graphic 
    (this was a drawing bug since centuries).

* Tour Blog ...

  - Set marker visible/hidden.
  - Show/hide hidden marker.
  - Draw marker with hidden/device/default color.
  - Improved hovered style.
  - Support for Linux.

* All Table/Tree Views

  New actions in the column header context menu.

  - Show all columns.
  - Show default columns.

- Changed wording
  "Transfer Tours ..." --> "Receive Tours ... serial port"

 
Fixed Bugs

  an error. This problem can be solved when XULrunner is installed, 
  see here...
