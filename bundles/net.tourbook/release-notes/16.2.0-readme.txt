IDEAS

* bug with body weight in reimport
* smooth power data

--------------------------------------------------------------------------





New
===	

* P2 + Tycho
  These are internal processes but there are no changes in the app, except that the software update procedure is different.
  P2 is writing in the app folder to keep internal data, before, these data were located in the user folder.
  The folders ... in the user folder can now be removed because they are not needed any more, there is no automatic cleanup.

* Table/Tree Columns
  - Organize column sets with profiles
  - Columns are categorized (when a view has ~ > 10 columns)
    !!! PREVIOUS COLUM ORDER HAS BEEN RESET !!! - this was necessary to have consistent data internally

* Power
  - Show power/powertrain/training values in the tourbook view (imported from .fit files)
  - Show power value in chart segment tooltip
  - Reimport power values
  
* Tour/Quick Editor
  - Edit body weight

* Import
  - .fit import is faster
    FIT SDK 16.60: -Changed Java File Encoder to use Checked Output Stream for added performance.
  

Bugfix

* Ongoing
