Version: 14.7.0                                                28.7.2014



Tour Marker
===========

* There are many improvements for the tour marker.

* New tour marker properties
- Description
- Internet address

* Tour marker editor is restructured.
- Edit new properties.
- Select a marker in the tour chart graphic.
- A moving slider in the tour chart (or selecting a marker) is also
  moved in an opened 2D/3D map view in the workspace.
- This is not the best solution but much better than before. It's a
  compromise because implementing a map within the marker dialog would
  be very very time consuming. The 2D/3D maps are tight very closely
  to the 2D/3D map views.

* Tour chart
- Slideout to set tour marker display options.
- Tooltip for a tour marker and open a url in the browser.
- Doubleclick a tour marker will open the marker dialog.
- Context menu actions for a marker.

* 3D Map
Map is positioned when a tour marker is selected in the tour chart and
the track sliders are displayed in the 3D map.


 
App 	
===

* App menu and toolbar is restructured.

* Tourmap Ansicht Tour Catalog is renamed into Tourmap Ansicht 
  Referenz Tours.

* Tour marker tab in the  tour editor is removed because it was a
  redundance of the tour marker view.

* Removed some actions from the workspace toolbars to streamline the
  UI, these actions are available in the application menu: Tagged
  Tour, Tour Analyzer, Tour Segmenter.

  
 
Elevation Gain 	
==============

The algorithm to compute the elevation gain/loss is replaced with the
Douglas Peucker algorithm.

The new algorithm can be fine tuned with the Douglas Peucker tolerance
which can be assessed in the tour segmenter.

These parts have been modified to implement the new algorithm.

* Preferences for computed values.
* The tour segmenter and the layer in the tour chart.
 

Why is the old algorithm replaced?

Because the author is now the owner of a .fit device and discovered on
the first tour, that the elevation gain with the old algorithm can be
significantly wrong, it depends on the terrain.


 
Improvements 	
============

* Table/Tree Columns
  Columns can be set visible/hidden in the header context menu in all
  tables/trees which are using the column manager.
* Tagging view
  Keep expanded/collapsed tags/categories when the view is closed and
  reopened.
* Tour Analyzer
  - Removed unnecessary digits.
  - Is updated when another tour is selected.
* Fit import
  Fixed problem when lap markers are saved in different formats in the
  .fit file.
* CSV import
  Altutide up/down can also be imported.

 
System 	
======

* Removed TourCategory entity, it have never been used.
* Removed some tour database tables which have never been used.
