Version: 14.14.0                                              22.11.2014

Info
====
This is VERY important

Create a BACKUP of your tour data BEFORE you start version 14.14.

Why ?

Version 14.14 will upgrade the tour database to a new database version. 
After this is done, there is NO possibility to open the tour database 
with an older version of MyTourbook.


Experimental 	
============

* Fulltext Search
  You can do a text search for tours, markers and waypoints.

* Current Limitations
  Any tours, markers or waypoints which are added, updated or deleted, 
  are not shown in the search result.
  Workaround for these limits
  Close the Search view and reopen it. This will create the fulltext 
  index from scratch, which takes about 1-3 seconds for 4000 tours with 
  a SSD disk.

 
System 	
======

* Derby database 10.11.1.1
